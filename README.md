# 🌍 Luntra — AI-Powered Language Learning Platform

Welcome to **Luntra**, a fictional language-learning startup focused on helping users master new languages primarily through **speaking practice**. This is a landing page project created as part of the **DirectED Bootcamp** frontend development journey.

## 📌 About the Project

Luntra aims to make language learning more effective by emphasizing **real conversations** with either an **AI partner** or a **human tutor**. Unlike traditional platforms that focus heavily on grammar or writing, Luntra puts **verbal interaction** first.

This project is a fully responsive landing page that introduces the platform, highlights its features, and provides an interactive experience for potential users.
